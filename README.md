# Project Structure

This repository contains the following code modules for training, evaluation, and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection:

- **Deep Ensemble Models**: The code for training and tuning deep ensemble models is located in `src_deep_ensemble/`.

- **Monte Carlo Dropout (MCDO)**: The implementation for Monte Carlo Dropout can be found in `src_MCDO/`.

- **Variational Inference with Flipout**: The code for variational inference using Flipout is in `src_variational_inference/`.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Code for obtaining evaluation metrics is available in `src_results/`.

- **OOD Metrics and Detection**: The scripts for calculating OOD metrics and performing OOD detection are in `src_ood/`.
